Open Source Connected Roller Garage Door Control Interface

There are tons of proprietory systems out there from dozens of different manufacturers. Many lock you in to a monthly subscription or require you to buy expensive hubs.

This project hopes to provide a simple solution, that does away with proprietory hardware, software and paid for cloud services.

Hardware:
Will use a ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar, as they have wifi, can handle a simple web server and also have lots of IO for connecting devices.

Will be working with a [roller garage door installer near me](https://chelmsfordrollerdoors.co.uk) for feedback and testing.
