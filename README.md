Open Source Connected Roller Garage Door Control Interface

There are tons of proprietory roller door control systems out there from dozens of different manufacturers. Many lock you in to a monthly subscription or require you to buy expensive hubs.

This project hopes to provide a simple solution, that does away with proprietory hardware, software and paid for cloud services that are pervasive in the roller garage door industry and smart homes generally.

Hardware:
Will use a ESP8266 or ESP32 or similar, as they have wifi, can handle a simple web server and also have lots of IO for connecting devices to monitor and control the roller garage door.

Home Assistant:
I'm an advocate of [home assistant](https://homeassistant.io), so integration to this will be important to the project, but it must be able to ooperate independantly too.

Will be working with a [roller garage door installer near me](https://chelmsfordrollerdoors.co.uk) for feedback and testing.
